      <h2>Aims of the society</h2>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Organization of annual international conferences on muscle biology and cell motility in different European countries. </li>
        <li>To create a platform for interaction between scientist active in research on skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle an in cell motility to stimulate interdisciplinary research collaborations within and outside Europe. </li>
        <li>To encourage young scientists to become involved in this research and offering them the possibilities to present and discuss their work in an informal environment. </li>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The European Society for Muscle Research was founded in 1971. The first meeting was organized in 1972 in Liege (Belgium). Since then annual meetings were organized without interruption in almost every European country and in Israel. Despite the initial exponential growth and a continuing increase in interest expressed by scientists outside Europe, it has maintained an informal atmosphere promoting lively discussions between junior and senior scientists and between colleagues from (former) Eastern and Western European countries. Many existing, and now EU-funded, networks have their roots in the ESMR, and maintain their relations via the annual meetings. </p>
